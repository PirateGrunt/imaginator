In addition to simulating losses, `imagine` will also simulate policy exposures. 

I'd like to siulate 10 years of policies, with fixed percentages in each year for a particular characteristic.

Or, I'd like to generate policies with a declining number of particular policies.

How do I define policy period?

Can I simulate something so that most of the effective dates fall on specific days?

# Case 1

```{r}
library(imagine)
dfPolicy <- NewPolicies(N = 5000, 2001, 1)
dfPolicy2 <- RenewPolicies(dfPolicy, Renewal = 0.65)
dfPolicy3 <- RenewPolicies(dfPolicy2, Renewal = 0.65)
```
