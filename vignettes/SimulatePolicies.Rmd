In addition to simulating losses, `stanard` will also simulate policy exposures. 

I'd like to siulate 10 years of policies, with fixed percentages in each year for a particular characteristic.

Or, I'd like to generate policies with a declining number of particular policies.

How do I define policy period?

Can I simulate something so that most of the effetive dates fall on specific days?
